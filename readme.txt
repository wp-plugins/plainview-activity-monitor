Plugin for PHP v5.4+ that monitors Wordpress hooks for user activity on a blog or network.

== Description ==

Plugin for PHP v5.4+ that monitors Wordpress hooks for user activity on a blog or network.

Currently monitored hooks:

* delete_post
* delete_user
* draft_to_publish
* password_reset
* profile_update
* publish_to_publish
* publish_to_trash
* retrieve_password
* trash_to_publish
* user_register
* wp_login
* wp_login_failed
* wp_login_failed but without logging the attempted password
* wp_logout
* wp_set_comment_status
* wpmu_delete_user

The logged information consists of:

* A description of what was logged
* Blog
* Timestamp
* Hook that was triggered
* User ID

The activities can then be shown in global table showing activities on the whole network, or locally for just the blog you are currently viewing.

The activites can also be filtered so that only specific blogs / hooks / IPs / users are displayed.

= Custom hooks =

If you are a plugin developer and wish to log your custom hooks, build a plugin that extends an Activity Monitor hook!

Step 1: Make sure that the Activity Monitor is available:

`if ( ! class_exists( '\\plainview\\wordpress\\activity_monitor\\Plainview_Activity_Monitor' ) )
	return;
`
Step 2: Create a custom hook. See any of the hooks in the `include/hooks` directory for examples.

Step 3: Hook into plainview_activity_monitor_manifest_hooks and then register your hook.

`add_action( 'plainview_activity_monitor_manifest_hooks', 'my_example_manifest_hooks' );

function my_example_manifest_hooks( $action )
{
	$hook = new my_example_hook();
	$my_example_hook->register_with( $action->hooks );
}`

Done!

Flesh out the log() or log_post() method in your hook class with something, enable the hook in the Activity Monitor settings and then wait for the hook to be called.

== Installation ==

1. Check that your web host has PHP v5.4.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Use the Wordpress support forum.

= I do not have PHP 5.4. Can I run the Activity Monitor? =

No. PHP 5.4 is required and has been released long enough for hosts to have had ample time to update.
